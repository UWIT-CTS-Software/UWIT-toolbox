## Features and Tools

### Checkerboard

Alex writes cool description here

### JackNet

Warning: Will not function over a wireless connection, needs a wired network connection to be able to ping the target devices.

Given a building or zone, will systematically send pings searching for devices and return a table/csv of information. This information will tell the user what rooms are not returning a signal. Using this they will be able to quickly determine if a room is offline or if a specific piece of equipment is offline and then export a file for the viewer to see.

The intended use for this is to quickly find devices that are not configured properly on the network and to sniff out devices that are simply offline.

### CamCode

...

### LSM/25Live integration (??)

Implement the ability to directly access LSM and/or 25Live through Bronson, yet to be implemented in any way whatsoever and is just an idea.
